### Abstract: 
In many of our university classes, we are required to work on projects. We often have to come up with our own projects ideas that will require the approval of the professor or TA. This can be a difficult process because there is not a really good way to submit your project ideas for the professor or TA to review. Even when all the ideas are submitted, it's a complete manual process for professor/TA to go through all the ideas, rate them and select the best ones.

### Summary:
- This will be a Web Application where students and professors can create and review projects to work on.
- The application will also act as recommendation engine for professor/TA to recommend the best ideas out of the submitted ones.

How will it work:
- The professor starts by creating a workspace for the class e.g. cmpe-272-fall-2018. 
- In this workspace, the professor adds a pool of optional projects ideas that students/teams can pick as their project. 
- Students or/and teams create a sub-workspace with their team name e.g. Team-5.
- Students can start adding project ideas to their team workspace. They can use a template form to keep each project idea organized. 
- Students can mark project ideas as completed and when the professor or TA logs in to the application they can start reviewing the completed project ideas. 
- All the project ideas submitted by students would be first automatically graded by the system. And once the professor or TA logs into the application, they would see the grading of each idea as recommended by the system. (The system will improve it's recommendation as the professor/TA interacts with it).
- Professor or TA can approve, deny, suggest improvement, etc. to each project idea. An email notification is sent to project members when the professors performs any action to their project ideas.
- The recommendation system will remember the choice and will use it's learning for better recommendation with each use.
- Other students can see the ideas from different teams and they can do a thumbs up if they think the idea is very interesting. 
- If a team has many very good project ideas, this team can allow other teams to pick any of their left over project ideas.
